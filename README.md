## .tar.gz backups

The script takes in a filepath of a .yaml file containing all the key-value mappings for the folders/files to be backed up

> See the example.yaml file for a practical example & more info

Example usage:
```python3 backup.py /home/username1/Documents/backup_mappings.yaml```

To override any clashes, use the ```-O``` / ```--override``` flag
