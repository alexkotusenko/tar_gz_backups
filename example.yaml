# the key is a STRING which is the location of the source file or folder to be taped (.tar) and compressed (.gz)
# the key value should correspond to a valid file or folder
#
# the value is a STRING which is the location of the output archive (.tar.gz)
# the parent folder of the output value specified should exist (because you can't just create a file in a folder that does not exist)
#
# the script will not override anything by default
# if you ever have a .tar.gz file with the same name at the same location, and the script is told to put the output at that very location, it will not override anything
# to override any clashes, pass the -O / --override parameter


# TIP: make sure to specify the .tar.gz extension the output filepaths for more clarity
# it's not required per se but avoids any confusion
